        2. Subway
        We would like to create the management system of the orders in a restaurant.
   (ok) Our restaurant only sells two kinds of items, Sandwiches and Drinks.
        Maintain a list of the ordered items and their prices.
        A drink has a fixed price based on its flavour.
        A sandwich's price is the sum of its ingredients' prices.
